Same Intuition as 0229
-Change avg;



New method
1. For 169

Use counter =0 
and make num = arr[0] 
    counter++ if num is again coming
    else 
    counter--
whenever counter==0 change the num to current value.


Intuition: Atleast once it will appear together and finally have above avg count making min count = 1


2. For 229
  
Use two counters and do same method
Note: Check if counters are not for same element
