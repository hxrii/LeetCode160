Using tortoise Method

make slow and fast variable
intitalise both to arr[0]

use the number inside array as next index to travel for both slow and fast
(slow = nums[slow])

Hence let slow travel 1 index at a time
Fast travel 2 index at a time

Slow and fast will meet at a point

From that point, let slow be there, move fast to arr[0]
both travel at pace 1
both meet at the repeating index
return slow
